# Week 12 - Poster and Further Evaluation

I ran the genetics algorithm for finding POS-tag weightings for a further 1000 epochs (2000 epochs) in total, it took about 2 hours and we found it still slightly increased accuracy on our validation process. This suggests that it hasn't reached it's inflection point of overfitting, and we need to train it more to see how much further these weightings can improve our models. It's important to note that the speed of the progress the genetics algorithm was making began to bottom-out and it took many more epochs to equally increasae it's accuracy. I'm expecting the next test to take a much longer period of time to produce any siginificant improvements.

We worked on the poster to present on Friday, that will summarise our findings.
