# Week 8 - Finding Optimal Weightings

This week we worked on finding the optimal weightings to maximise performance of our classifier. I wrote a genetics inspired algorithm to iteratively build and test new weightings. We found it improved its own performance quite quickly, halting when it reached 100% accuracy on it's (small) test set.
