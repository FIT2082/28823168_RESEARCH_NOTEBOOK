# Week 11 - Bringing Dave to Slack

With a decent intent classification model, and a solution also for entity extraction we worked on building a demo for our presentation next week. This involved interacting with the Slack API that would feed sentences to our model, and forward it's responses to a Slack channel. Our model needed to be reconstructed to use both the intent classification and entity extraction systems we have developed over the course of the semester.
