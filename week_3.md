# Week 3 - Research

We looked at previous examples of Natural language process and the tools we might use to solve our problems. Specifically we need tools to assist us with feature extraction and semantic understanding.

### Some tools

* Gensim
  Gensim is a python library "Generate Similar" commonly used to compare "documents", aka sentences.
* FastText
  Fasttext is a library developed by Facebook AI Research that builds upon word2vec. Great for labbelled data but may be too simple for our project.
* TensorFlow w/ Word2Vec
  TensorFlow is a very popular framework with heaps of support libraries. Word2Vec is a common library that converts words to vectors.
* NTLK semantics
  NLTK is another popular framework in python with many packages included. It is popular for POStagging, feature extraction and semantic understanding
