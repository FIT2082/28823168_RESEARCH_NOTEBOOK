# Week 10 - Evaluating our POS weightings
With our new data we could analyse the effectiveness of our solution. Using a small-ish training to build the POS-tag weightings with our genetics algorithm, we evaluated the difference these weightings made when training a model on a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT dataset. NOTE: Our completely different dataset also included additional categories!! (extra labels that were not seen in the training process for the POS-weightings). This validation model increased from 82.6% to 90.6% after apply our optimal weightings. This enforces our solution of POS-weighting as an effective technique for text classification. Also, we are pretty sure this is quite an uncommon/unknown technique, which is interesting as the results are outstanding for text-classification problem like Teaching Dave English.
